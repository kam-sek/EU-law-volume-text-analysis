# BR-and-legislative-production

This is the code for a Bruegel Analysis piece, "Simplifying EU Law: A Cumbersome Task with Mixed Results" by Kamil Sekut and J. Scott Marcus. The paper is available at https://www.bruegel.org/analysis/simplifying-eu-law-cumbersome-task-mixed-results. The package consists of five Jupyter notebooks, numbered in the order in which they should be run.

1_eurlex_scrape.ipynb scrapes the data from EurLex,
2_eurlex_analysis.ipynb analyzes this data,
3_proposals_download.ipynb downloads the content of each regulation,
4_word_count.ipynb provides a word count for each regulation and its sections,
5_proposals_content_analysis.ipynb uses the data from the two previous scripts to produce additional graphs.
