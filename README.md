# BR-and-legislative-production

This is the code for a Bruegel Analysis piece, "Simplifying EU Law: A Cumbersome Task with Mixed Results" by J. Scott Marcus and Kamil Sekut. The analysis is available at https://www.bruegel.org/analysis/simplifying-eu-law-cumbersome-task-mixed-results. The package consists of five Jupyter notebooks, numbered in the order in which they should be run.

The purpose of the project is to monitor changes in the total volume of EU legislation by Commission. Data on legal acts is scraped from Eur-Lex, the official repository of EU legislation, and subsequently used to visualise trends in the number and length of legislative acts, as well as the number of repeals by Commission.

1\_eurlex\_scrape.ipynb scrapes the data from EurLex,
2\_eurlex\_analysis.ipynb analyzes this data,
3\_proposals\_download.ipynb downloads the content of each regulation,
4\_word\_count.ipynb provides a word count for each regulation and its sections,
5\_proposals\_content\_analysis.ipynb uses the data from the two previous scripts to produce additional graphs.
